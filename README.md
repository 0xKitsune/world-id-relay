## WorldID Relay

The `world-id-relay` is responsible for listening to new roots from the `WorldIdIdentityManager` and propagating them various L2s specified within the configuration file. To successfully propagate roots to a target L2, you will need a `StateBridge` contract deployed on L1, a `BridgedWorldID` contract deployed on the target L2 and a cross chain messaging protocol to send the root from L1 to the L2. For a detailed walkthrough on how to set up and deploy the necessary components, you can [read more here](https://worldcoin.org/blog/announcements/new-state-bridge-update-enables-permissionless-integration-world-id).

The `world-id-relay` uses a toml file to specify state bridge configurations. To see an example check out the [bin/relay.toml](./bin/relay.toml).
